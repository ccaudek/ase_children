Data and scripts for the manuscript "Age-Dependent Changes in the Anger Superiority Effect: Evidence from a Visual Search Task".

A representative example of a dynamic transition involving one face in our visual task is shown by following this [link]("https://rawcdn.githack.com/ccaudek/ase_children/67a0130b4d3ce529ea970e6da9f0fc1d043f3b0d/stimuli/angry4.mp4"). Please note that, for the purpose of this demonstration, we have extended the duration during which the face remains in a static state. In the real experimental setup, this interval lasted only 300 ms.
