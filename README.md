Data and scripts for the manuscript "Age-Dependent Changes in the Anger Superiority Effect: Evidence from a Visual Search Task".

A representative example of a dynamic transition involving one face in our visual task is shown by following this [link]("stimuli/angry4.mp4"). Please note that, for the purpose of this demonstration, we have extended the duration during which the face remains in a static state. In the real experimental setup, this interval lasted only 300 ms.
