Data and scripts for the manuscript "Age-Dependent Changes in the Anger Superiority Effect: Evidence from a Visual Search Task".

A representative example of a dynamic transition involving one face in our visual task is shown in the mp4 file located in the `stimuli` folder. Please note that, for the purpose of this demonstration, we have extended the duration during which the face remains in a static state. In the real experimental setup, this interval lasted only 300 ms.
